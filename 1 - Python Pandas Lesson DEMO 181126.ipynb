    "Pandas was develped by Wes McKinney (from Akron, Ohio!!!). Math guy from MIT that went into finance, found that the problem with hedge fund management was dealing with the data (sourcing new data, merging it with the old, and cleaning it all up to optimize the input). He got bummed out with Excel and R but was smitten with Python, though he realized there was no robust package for data analysis. So he built Pandas in 2008 and released the project to the public in 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where it get's crazy, he left the world if finance to pursue a PhD in statistics at Duke, thus dropping Pandas development. During that period he realized Python as a language could explode as a statistical computing language, it had the potential, but was still missing robust packages. So he dropped out to push Pandas to become the a cornerstone of the Python scientific ecosystem.\n",
